# How to contribute

We appreciate all pull requests. However, before working on an enhancement/feature, you should:
- Search to see if there's  already a discussion on the [Issue Tracker](https://github.com/twschiller/open-synthesis/issues). If not, you should [start a new discussion](https://github.com/twschiller/open-synthesis/issues/new)
- Let us know you're working on the issue, so that we can (1) help fill in any gaps in the requirements, and (2) avoid having multiple contributors do redundant work

## Local Development

### Requirements

To perform local development, you'll need:
* Python 3.6
* [pip](https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable/installing/)
* [virtualenv](https://virtualenv.pypa.io/en/stable/)
* [node](https://nodejs.org/en/download/package-manager/)
* [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/)
* [libmemcached](https://libmemcached.org/) for using an external [memcached](https://memcached.org/) in-memory cache. Install on MacOSX Homebrew with `brew install libmemcached`. If you do not want to enable external caching during deployment, you can skip this requirement. However, you will have to exclude `pylibmc` from `requirements.txt` before installing the project Python requirements.

To create your own deployment on Heroku, you may also want the [Heroku Toolbelt](https://devcenter.heroku.com/articles/getting-started-with-python#introduction).

### Building

Clone the repository and switch to the project directory:

    git clone https://github.com/twschiller/open-synthesis.git
    cd open-synthesis

Create a project-specific package environment using virtualenv:

    virtualenv venv

Switch to the virtualenv. On Windows, run this command:

    venv\Scripts\activate.bat
    
On Mac/Linux, run this command:

    source venv/bin/activate

Install the project requirements:

    pip install -r requirements.txt
    npm install

Create a local environment configuration by copying the defaults in `env.sample`:

    cp env.sample .env
        
Package the static files for the project:
    
    npm run build
    python manage.py collectstatic
 
Run the test suite to ensure your environment is properly configured:

    python manage.py test

Create the database schema, and load the initial application data:

    python manage.py migrate
    python manage.py loaddata source_tags 
   
### Web Server
   
To run the Django development server, which automatically reloads modules when you
edit a file:

    python manage.py runserver
   
To serve the Django application using [Gunicorn](http://gunicorn.org/):

    gunicorn -c conf.py openintel.wsgi --log-file -
    
If you are using Heroku, you can also run the Gunicorn server with:    
    
    heroku local web
    
### Celery Task Runner
    
If you have a local instance of [Redis](http://redis.io/), you can configure Celery to use
it as broker/result store by setting `REDIS_URL` and `CELERY_ALWAYS_EAGER` in the `.env` file:

    REDIS_URL=redis://localhost:6379
    CELERY_ALWAYS_EAGER=False
    
Then run the Celery worker:

    celery worker --app=openintel.celery.app
    
If you are using Heroku, you can also run the worker with:

    heroku local worker
    
## Code Style and Testing

Before submitting a pull request, please review the 
[quality control wiki](https://github.com/twschiller/open-synthesis/wiki/Quality-Controls).

## Adding a Translation

If you want to help translate Open Synthesis but don't want to set up local development environment, let us know
and we'll assist you.

First, if you haven't already, follow the instructions above to [set up your local development environment](#local-development). 
Next, install [GNU gettext](https://www.gnu.org/software/gettext/).
If you're using [Homebrew](http://brew.sh/index.html), the following commands install and link gettext:

    brew install gettext
    brew link --force gettext

Create a translation file for your locale with the [makemessages](https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/1.10/ref/django-admin/#makemessages) 
command. A list of language codes is available [here](http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/javase7locales-334809.html).
For example, to create a British English translation, use the following command:

    python manage.py makemessages --locale=en_GB

This will create a folder for the locale in the `locale` directory with a messages file `django.po`. Translate the
messages by filling in the `msgstr` fields in the messages file.

Compile the translations with the [compilemessages](https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/1.10/ref/django-admin/#compilemessages) 
command:

    python manage.py compilemessages

Add your translation to the `openintel/settings.py` file. Note that the language corresponding to the locale is lower
case and uses a hyphen `-` instead of an underscore `_`. So locale `en_GB` becomes `en-gb`:

    LANGUAGES = (
        ('en', _('English (United States)')),
        ('en-gb', _('English (British)')),
    )

Your translation should now be available when you restart your server. If you're still seeing English, double-check
that your browser is requesting the page in the language you created.
