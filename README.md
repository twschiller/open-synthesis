## 2024-03-09: THIS REPOSITORY IS IN MAINTENANCE MODE

This repository is in maintenance mode. I will be appplying security dependency updates, but am not accepting issues/PRs.

## Goals

The purpose of the Open Synthesis project is to empower the public to synthesize vast amounts of information into actionable conclusions.

To this end, the platform and its governance aims to be:

1. Inclusive
2. Transparent
3. Meritocratic

Our approach is to take best practices from the intelligence and business communities and adapt them to work with internet
communities.

## Analysis of Competing Hypotheses (ACH)

Initially, the platform will support the [Analysis of Competing Hypotheses (ACH) framework.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Analysis_of_competing_hypotheses)
ACH was developed by Richards J. Heuer, Jr. for use at the United States Central Intelligence Agency (CIA).

The ACH framework is a good candidate for public discourse because:

* ACH's hypothesis generation and evidence cataloging benefit from a diversity of perspectives
* ACH's process for combining the viewpoints of participants is straightforward and robust
* ACH can account for unreliable evidence, e.g., due to deception

The initial implementation will be similar to [competinghypotheses.org](http://competinghypotheses.org/). However, we
will adapt the implementation to address the challenges of public discourse.

## Platform Design Principles

The platform will host the analysis of politically sensitive topics. Therefore, its design must strike a balance between
freedom of speech, safety, and productivity. More specific concerns include:

* Open-Source Licensing and Governance
* Privacy
* Accessibility
* Internationalization and Localization
* Moderation vs. Censorship
